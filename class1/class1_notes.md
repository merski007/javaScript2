Week 1 discussion: What motivates you?
My motivation comes from the opportunity to learn new skills and enhance the skills I have already attained. This can be applied to all aspects of my life. From cooking/baking in the kitchen, working in the garage on projects, or advancing my coding skills to further my career. It is also the reason why I have settled on software development as my career of choice. I could spend multiple lifetimes learning different languages and design patterns, and still not know everything there is to know. The sky is truly the limit when it comes to mastering this field.

One final comment I can make on the video is that it is absolutely true. Here is an example from my own personal experience. 

One of my hobbies is wood working. I love watching tips and tricks videos on YouTube and experimenting in the garage. It challenges both my creativity and ability when starting a project. And there is no better feeling then successfully building something and having it in the house a piece of furniture.

Recently a friend asked me to build a table for them. They paid for all the materials and my labor. So, all my costs were covered. However, it was the most boring project I did and I dreaded working on it. I eventually finished it and it turned out great, but I wonâ€™t be doing any friends projects anytime soon. Or turning my hobby into a career.
